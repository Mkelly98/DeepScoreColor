SceneDetect is used to separate a video into a directory of multiple small clips. It uses director cuts to form scenes.	
	SceneDetect orignal code: https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect
	-creates a folder of clips
  
  
	dirFrames.py is used to take the directory of clips and convert them in to clips. This makes getting the pallette info way easier.
	- code: https://github.com/Mkelly98/DeepScoreColor/blob/master/dirFrames.py
	- just save this to the directory in which you are working in
  
  
	Colorific is used for obtaing the color palette of frames. The code will now create a csv file that will give RGB values and color names.
